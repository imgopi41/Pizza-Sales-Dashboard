**VI. Data Cleaning using DAX Queries**

1. Replaced values for Pizza Size initially it was single Letter changed it with its names i.e ( M = "Medium")

2. To total Orders of Pizza by Order Id Dax Query was written
i.e [ Total Orders = Distinct Count (Pizza Sales [Order id]) ]

3. To check average amount spent per order was calculated by dividing it with total revenue
i.e [Avg Order Value = [ Total Revenue ] / [ Total Orders ] ]

4. To get Sum of Pizza Quantities of all Pizza Sold
i.e ( Total Pizza Sold = Sum (Pizza sales [ Quantity ] ))

5. To calculate Avg Number of Pizza's sold per order, & also Calculated it by dividing it with total number of Pizza sold by the total number of orders.
i.e ( Avg Pizza Per Order = [ Total Pizza sold ] / [ Total order] )


**Data Processing in Power BI**

1. Converted Date into day to display day name by using order date, From Day name i have took only first three letter to display "Monday" to "Mon".

Dax Query : Order day = Upper Left (( Pizza Sales ) [ Day name] , 3))

2. New Column has been created in the name of "Day Number" to display the Day number with respect to Day.
   Eg : Sunday day number is shown as 1 followed by other days too.
